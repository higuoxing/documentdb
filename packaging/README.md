# To Build Your Own Packages With Docker

## Building Debian/Ubuntu Packages

Run `./packaging/build_packages.sh -h` and follow the instructions.
E.g. to build for Debian 12 and PostgreSQL 16, run:

```sh
./packaging/build_packages.sh --os deb12 --pg 16
```

## Building RPM Packages

For Red Hat-based distributions, you can build RPM packages:

```sh
./packaging/build_packages.sh --os rhel8 --pg 17
```

Supported RPM distributions:
- rhel8 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8)
- rhel9 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9)

## Output

Packages can be found at the `packages` directory by default, but it can be configured with the `--output-dir` option.

**Note:** The packages do not include pg_documentdb_distributed in the `internal` directory.
